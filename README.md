## Summary
*Include a brief summary that describes your system that your are modelling*

The system that is being modelled is the hierarchy of the staff at a software development company. The user is an individual who is working for the Human Resources Department and is using a Human Resources Information System that provides information about the CEO, Software Development Managers, and Software Developers. The program provides information such as the employeeâ€™s first name, last name, home address, medical information, and salary. Depending on the position of the employee such as CEO vs a Developer, there is other information that is provided. The user will go through each level of the hierarchy from CEO to the Developers and at the end, a Human Resources Report is provided that provides information about the number of employees and payroll.
